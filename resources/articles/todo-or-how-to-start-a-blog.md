**Are you blogging?**

**Do you think you should?**

**Why aren't you?**

I'm asking because it took me 4 months until I finally started.
It's probably the same for you.

![TODO](/images/asana-blog.png)

Reasons for taking so long include:
  * Not knowing what to write about,
  * Worrying about being irrelevant,
  * Fear of negative reactions,
  * Being too picky about my website's style,
  * Wanting to do everything myself,
  * The list goes on...

### But it's time. Time to *ship*.

What are you waiting for? Let's answer your objections:

  * **Don't know what to write about?** Take a topic, any topic, and
    dissect into small parts.
  * **You worry about being irrelevant?** If you learned
    something yesterday, odds are more people don't know that already.
  * **You fear negative reactions?** Know this: the people who do the
    least are often the most vocal.
  * **Your site is not perfect?** Look. You can try to vertically center align pictures of
    yourself for hours at a time if that's what you want, but
    that doesn't bring you any closer to shipping. You can buy
    professional templates online for the price of a happy meal at
    McDo: Don't be silly.
  * **You want to do everything yourself?** That's the curse of every programmer. Learn to let go!

Note: When I use *you* I'm mostly talking to myself. But I'm sure
some of you can benefit from this internal discussion.

So... There it is. My first blog article. It sure ain't perfect. But the
ball is rolling.

As a reader, what should you expect is coming next?
Well… I'm really into business,
software and marketing, a bit like @patio11.
I'd say I'm "same same, but different".
I'm not internet famous, nor do I have a business serving teachers, nor do
I even have a business (*yet*), and… I am also 23.

*YET*, I'm hungry.
For success,
experiences,
life, and for food.

I'm out for lunch.

'Till next week.
