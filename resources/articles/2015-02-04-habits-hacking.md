<strong>
Did you ever start something... only to stop 4 months later?
</strong>

<strong>
Did you ever get a gym membership... only to stop going 2 weeks later?
</strong>

<strong>
Did you ever wish you could stop starting things and just keep doing
them instead?
</strong>

There's two problems I'd like to address:

1. It's **too easy** to start doing things.
2. It's **too hard** to keep doing them.

It's too easy to start doing things because we do it all the time.
Only the best among us are able to focus and keep doing the right things all the time.
We start working out, playing an instrument, writing, reading books, meditating, etc.
And then we stop doing it.
It's too hard to keep doing them.
Why?
Because we're too ambitious at first.
When it's new, we're excited.
We tell our friends.
We tell our loved ones.
"Look at me I'm doing this now!"
I said.
Three weeks later.
It's not exciting anymore.
I forget.
I'm too busy.
I don't have the time.
I stop doing it.

Sounds familiar? Yes? Keep reading. No? Keep reading ;-)

So there's this one thing I'd like you to think about.

But first, I'd like to ask you a question.
Which of the following two is easier?

1. To **start** a habit of working out one hour, four times a week.
2. To **upgrade** from doing it thirty minutes, four times a week, to one hour, four times a week.

The answer should be obvious.

We don't spend the time to reflect on this though, and *that* is the biggest problem.
What we need is a stair step approach, we need to:

1. **Start Small**
2. **Track our Progress**
3. **Upgrade**

### Start Small

I can't stress this enough.
Step number one should not be praise worthy.
If you tell your friends "Hey I've started doing X", it should not impress them.
To risk repeating myself: the hard part is **maintaining** the habit.
The obvious solution: you should make it *easier* to maintain.

Your habit should be doable:
* Even if you are in a bad mood,
* Even if you are not motivated,
* Even if you are busy,
* Even if you don't have the time.

If you want to start meditating,
start with one minute, every day.
It is absolutely impossible to not have the time for it.

If you want to start working out,
Start with ten minutes four times a week.
If you need to physically move to a place (a gym for instance, or a rock-climbing gym (like me :D)),
start with thirty.

**Pro tip:** My weekends are absolutely sacred and a *no-go* zone for my habits.
They are dedicated to my significant other, friends, and family.
If you are like me and think it's impossible to maintain one during the weekend,
then do this: don't schedule them on the weekends!

### Track your Progress

[Nathan Barry][1] has this right.
If you don't know him, he is a guy who wanted to write a book.
So he started writing 1000 words… every single day.
He wrote the first in 90 days,
and the second within the same year.
He kept going and wrote a third.

To help himself, and others, he made an app called [Commit][2].
Every day, his phone sends him a message:

"Did you write a thousand words today?"

In his own words, here comes a profound concept: *Don't break the chain.*
I repeat: **Don't break the chain.**

But he's not the only one who did this though.
Stephen King writes 2000 every day.
Jack London between 1000 and 1500.
You can find more examples in [Daily Rituals][3] (an excelent book by the way).

**Key idea:** keep track of what you are trying to accomplish...
Nathan Barry has Commit.
I use [Habit Streak Pro][4].
My brother a plain old calendar with big fat X'ses on it.
*How* you do it is less important than doing it.

**Remember**: regardless of *what* you are trying to achieve, it's not a sprint but a marathon that will lead you there.

Think of all the things most people want to achieve in life.
Being fit, playing an instrument,
being a good writer, owning a successful business, being a better climber,
learning to code…
Does any one of those goals sound like easily realizable in a sprint?

* Try gaining muscle/loosing fat in a week.
* Try learning to play an instrument in a week.
* Try becoming a great writer in a week.
* Making a baby in less than 9 months.
* Owning a successful company in a week.
* Climbing V5 in a week.
* Learning to code…


So?
**Create a chain.**
**And don't break it.**

### Upgrade

Here comes the fun part.
Now that you know that you *can* maintain a habit.
Start experimenting with an "upgraded" version.

* Workout forty-five minutes instead of thirty,
* Practice your instrument for fifteen minutes instead of ten,
* Write five hundred words instead of two hundred and fifty,
* etc.

Does it stick?
Are you able to do it?
If yes, keep doing it (and congratulations)!
If not, just roll back to your previous one.

The key point here is that the question's focus is no longer on doing or not doing, but on **how much** you *are* doing.
The difference between the two is *huge*.

### Conclusion

So, we've covered a framework to create habits that *stick*.
You must start with something small, keep track of your progress, and routinely try to upgrade it.

Well known people such as Jack London and Stephen King do it, and are successful.
Less well known people such as Nathan Barry and [this girl who wanted to learn to dance][dance] are doing it.
I'm doing it (with success stories: my climbing and piano progress are through the ROOF!).
Why not you?

What do you think?
Convinced?
Not convinced?

What about the writing?  I'm new a this "blogging thing."
