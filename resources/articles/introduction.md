### Story time

Are you blogging?

Do you think you should?

Why aren't you?

I'm asking because it took me 4 months until I finally did it.
Here's a screenshot of my current asana "goals" list:

![TODO](/images/asana-blog.png)

Reasons for taking so long include:
  * Not knowing what to write about,
  * Worrying about not providing value to others,
  * Obtaining negative reactions to what I do,
  * Being called a fraud or something along those lines,
  * Being too picky about my website's template,
  * Wanting to do everything myself,
  * The list goes on...

It's finally time.
Time to break this chain and *ship*.

Here are some things that you should think about if you are
*still* not doing it (or anything else on your list of goals for
that matter).

  * Dissect a topic down, anything.
  * Shut up. If you learned something yesterday, odds are there are
    lots of other people who don't know that already.
  * Know this: the people who do the least are the most vocal.
  * The fact you are asking yourself this question solves that
    problem. It's not like you wake up accidentally using other
    people. If it's not your intention, you're not doing it!
  * Look. You can try to vertically center align pictures of
    yourself four hours at a time if that's what you want, but
    that doesn't bring you any closer to shipping. You can buy
    professional templates online for the price of a happy meal at
    McDo. Don't be silly.
  * The curse of the programmer. Learn to let go!

Get over yourself.

Note: When I use *you* I'm mostly talking to myself. But I'm sure
some of you can benefit from this internal discussion.

So... There you go. My first blog article.

What's coming up?
Well I'm a guy that is really into business,
software and marketing, a bit like @patio11.
Same same, but different.
I'm not internet famous, nor do I have a business serving teachers, nor do
I even have a business (*yet*) for that matter.
I am also 23, which would certainly roll the eyes of all the
seasoned veterans out there.

*YET*, I'm hungry.
For knowledge,
for experiences,
for life, and, lastly, for food.

I'm really hungry.

I'm out for lunch.

'Till next week.
