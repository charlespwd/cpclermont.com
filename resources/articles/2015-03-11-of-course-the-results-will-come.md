*This is follow-up on [the post from last week](/blog/redpoint)*.

I failed. (Sort of). I did not ship in a week. Christ. It's not for lack
of determination, or focus, or skill. Things take time. You don't build
a business in a week. It's non sense. I don't know why I even believed
that.

But it brought me to some profound realizations.

1. Nobody cares about you.
2. Stop associating success with results.

I know I know. That's kind of cheezy. But let me explain for a minute. In
four months, I went from climbing V3 to V5. For all you non-climbing
nerds, it took me 2 years to get from V0 to V3, and 4 months from V3 to
V5. In three months, I went from not being able to read notes on the piano
to sight read C Major fluently. In those same four months however, I set
myself 20 thousand business goals and I'm not happy with the results.

* “Ship your website in a week”
* “Make a Shopify App in a week”
* “Find a client in a week”
* ...

The list goes on.

Perhaps you are better at calling people on their shit than I am.
But there’s a substantial difference between what I did in
climbing and sight-reading vs what I did in business. In climbing,
I just fucking do it. In playing the piano, I just fucking do it.
In business, I want more more more more and get frustrated and let
down when things are not as I want them at the end of the week.

I need to let go.

That doesn’t mean I need to stop doing what I was doing however.
I’m making progress in other areas because I *consistently* do
the *right* things *without* worrying about the results. Of
course the results will come, I climb 4 days a week. Of course the
results will come, I play the piano every day. Of course the
results will come, I work on the right things every day.

It’s time to dissociate the expectations from the doing. Set your
goal, work on the right things, and *of course the results will come*.
