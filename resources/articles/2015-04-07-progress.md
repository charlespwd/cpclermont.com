Checking in on April 7th. I'm building a Shopify App. It's 80% finished. It's
basically [Baremetrics](https://baremetrics.com) for Shopify stores. An answer
to Andrew, from [eCommerceFuel](https://ecommercefuel.com), who asked for
a better way to calculate % returning customers. I tweeted him, he told me he
spends an hour every month to make this report.

Sounds like opportunity to me, so I started coding.

Landing page is at the top of the list. Marketing happens by just being helpful
to people on the forums.
