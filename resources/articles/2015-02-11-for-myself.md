This is a selfish post.

I am not writing it for others.

I am writing it for myself.

It's also one I'd like to re-read in a year.

You want to start a business?
A side project?
Passive income?
Yes?
Do this.
Do that.
Don't do this.
No don't do this.
Do it.
Don't do it.
Reflect.
Don't reflect.
Go!
No Go!
Do!
Don't DO!

It's exhausting.

What should you listen to?
Who should you listen to?
Aaargh...

Who do you want to serve?
Should you?
Why are you doing this?
Am I doubting?
No I'm not.
Am I not doubting?
No I'm not.

What do?

What should you focus on?
What's moving you forward?
Hey!
Look!

A shiny object!

...

You know what?
I think I'm ready.
I reached the point where I know what people are talking about.
I reached a point where I'm like:
No.
Ef you.
You are wrong.
This is not how you should go about it.

I think that's it.
No BS.
Just doing it.

Don't waste time on ideas.
They should come last.

Start with the people.
Who are they?
What do they want?
Study them.
What's their problem?
Do they even know it's a problem?
Is it a problem that waits to show up, or are they actively looking for a solution?
Are they willing to pay you for it?
If not, don't waste your time.

The whole process, making stuff and finding an idea, is painful.
But you keep going.

"If you are going through hell, keep going."
 â€¦ right?

That's what's up.

How can I deliver value to people today?
What would be valuable to people?

You know what I'd like to learn?

"How do you market to people without sounding like a sleazy marketer."
"How do you get people interested in what you are writing without resorting to sleazy techniques"
Now *That* is something I want to learn.

I can't write it *yet* because I don't know how to do it.
I guess that'll come.
As long as I deliver value.

This stuff is tough.
It's hard.

You're alone.

You keep asking yourself twenty bazillion questions, all the time.

But, you know what? I won't stop.

I'm convinced I can help people.

And I will.

I guess the hard thing, right now, is to be credible.
How do you do that with no network, and without enough experience?
I mean, I've been programming since high-school.
Back when I was 12 years old.
That's almost 12 years ago...

How do you get people interested in you,
 to trust you,
 when you haven't done anything grandiose *yet*?

It seems the way to go is to ef-ing do it for yourself.

Well, that's where I'm at right now.

And I won't stop.

It's on baby.

*It's on.*
